This directory provides wrappers for netcdf packages. These could be used more
generally (outside of cprnc), although currently the API only provides the
functionality needed by cprnc. This includes quite a bit of read functionality,
but no write functionality.

Outside code should import netcdf_wrapper - in particular, this would work well:
from cprnc_py.netcdf.netcdf_wrapper import netcdf

This 'netcdf' symbol is then a subclass of NetcdfFile (defined in
netcdf_file.py) (client code should not care *which* subclass it is).

The NetcdfFile class (in netcdf_file.py) serves two purposes:

(1) Provides a common API through which any python netCDF package can be used

(2) Provides some higher-level methods on top of these netCDF packages

This class should then be subclassed by classes specific to a given python
netCDF package (e.g., scipy.io.netcdf, netCDF4, etc.). As can be seen from
netcdf_file_scipy.py, these subclasses are often relatively simple.

The NetcdfVariable class (in netcdf_variable.py) serves a similar role for a
single variable in a netCDF file. Again, this should be subclassed by classes
specific to a given python netCDF package. Currently, this is not used directly
by cprnc (and is not provided by netcdf_wrapper) - rather, cprnc uses a
NetcdfFile, which provides access to anything needed from a NetcdfVariable
(e.g., NetcdfFile.get_vardata(varname, dimindices) provides the functionality of
NetcdfVariable.get_data(dim_indices)).

Fake versions of NetcdfFile and NetcdfVariable are provided to support unit
testing. These allow a unit test to create a fake, in-memory NetcdfFile,
containing whatever data it wants; this fake "file" can then be used by the
system under test.
