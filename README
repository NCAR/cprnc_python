Design notes
------------

* For each variable, we compute and save all needed statistics on the variable
  in the initialization of that variable's object. These statistics can then be
  queried or printed later.

  This is more complex than just computing statistics as we need them (e.g., by
  the __str__ method). However, the current design allows the variable's data to
  be garbage collected after the computations are done. This, in turn, allows
  the separation of computation from printing of results, which could lend
  itself better to parallelization of the computations.
